This is a small, Tetris style game, inspired by the original tetris.

A few small changes different to the official Tetris:
When a tetromino is "droped" (spacebar) there is a delay before it gets placed, similar to how it is when the block naturally falls.
The block order is randomized, this is different to the official game since the order of blocks is semi-randomized in the official game to cycle equally thoughout all the blocks
The score is recorded by lines, not points
There is no level system, the speed still ramps up based on score, but differently than the original game

Look through the code to see how it works.
